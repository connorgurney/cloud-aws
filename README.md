# Infrastructure-as-code for AWS account

This repository contains [infrastructure-as-code][iac] to set up and configure
my [Amazon Web Services][vendor] (AWS) account, including billing, identity and
access, and logging.

In an effort to avoid duplicating my effort, I document how I configure and use
AWS and other cloud providers on my [documentation site][docs] instead of this
repository.
